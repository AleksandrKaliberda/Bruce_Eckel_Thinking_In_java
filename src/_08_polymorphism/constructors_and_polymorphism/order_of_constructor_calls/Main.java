        1. The base-class constructor is called. This step is repeated recursively such
        that the root of the hierarchy is constructed first, followed by the
        next-derived class, etc., until the most-derived class is reached.

        2. Member initializers are called in the order of declaration.

        3. The body of the derived-class constructor is called.

        Output:
        Meal()
        Lunch()
        PortableLunch()
        Bread()
        Cheese()

        The order of the constructor calls is important. When you inherit, you know all about the
        base class and can access any public and protected members of the base class. This means
        that you must be able to assume that all the members of the base class are valid when youâ€™re
        in the derived class. In a normal method, construction has already taken place, so all the
        members of all parts of the object have been built. Inside the constructor, however, you must
        be able to assume that all members that you use have been built. The only way to guarantee
        this is for the base-class constructor to be called first.
